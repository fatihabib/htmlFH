        <p><h3 style="color: rgb(12, 65, 55); align-items: left;">I would not exchange the sorrows of my heart<br>
            For the joys of the multitude.<br>
            And I would not have the tears that sadness makes<br>
            To flow from my every part turn into laughter.<br>
            
            I would that my life remain a tear and a smile.<br>
            
            A tear to purify my heart and give me understanding<br>
            Of life's secrets and hidden things.<br>
            A smile to draw me nigh to the sons of my kind and<br>
            To be a symbol of my glorification of the gods.<br>
            
            A tear to unite me with those of broken heart;<br>
            A smile to be a sign of my joy in existence.<br>
            I would rather that I died in yearning and longing  than that I live weary and despairing.<br>
          


            I want the hunger for love and beauty to be in the<br>
            Depths of my spirit,for I have seen those who are<br>
            Satisfied the most wretched of people.<br>
            I have heard the sigh of those in yearning and longing,
            and it is sweeter than the sweetest melody.<br>
            

            With evening's coming the flower folds her petals<br>
            And sleeps, embracing her longing.<br>
            At morning's approach she opens her lips to meet<br>
            The sun's kiss.<br>
            The life of a flower is longing and fulfilment.<br>
            A tear and a smile.<br>

            
            The waters f the sea become vapor and rise and come<br>
            Together and are a cloud.<br>

            
            And the cloud floats above the hills and valleys<br>
            Until it meets the gentle breeze, then falls weeping<br>
            To the fields and joins with brooks and rivers to return to the sea, its home.<br>

            
            The life of clouds is a parting and a meeting.<br>
            A tear and a smile.<br>
            And so does the spirit become separated from<br>
            The greater spirit to move in the world of matter<br>
            And pass as a cloud over the mountain of sorrow<br>
            And the plains of joy to meet the breeze of death<br>
            And return whence it came.<br>
            
            To the ocean of Love and Beauty----to God.<br></h3></p>
